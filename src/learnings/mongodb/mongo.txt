With mongo cli / mongosh we can create db on our local hard disk

Open mongosh and type command "mongosh", this will start the connection and show you the url of your cluster

At this point you can type a command "show dbs" to show all dbs in your cluster

To select a db use command "use <db name>"

To select/show a collection in this db use command "use / show <db name>"

If db / collection in not present in use command it will create a new Open

To add documents in collections > we can use functions like insertOne({key:"value"}) and insertMany([{key:"value"},{key:"value"},{key:"value"}])

Various data types can be used in the value field > string, boolean, number, double, aonther document ( a key value pair doc ) etc.

To list all the documents in a collection use > db( the current selected db ).collectionName.find()

To list all the documents and sort it in ASC/DESC > db( the current selected db ).collectionName.find().sort({field name which needs to be sorted : ASC 1 / DESC -1})

Default sorting is with objectId field (FIFO)

Use limit method to fetch only a certain number of documents > db.collectionName.find().limit(5) > gives first 5 docs sorted by objectId

To filter the documents in a collection use > db.collectionName.find({field name which needs to be filtered : search,field name which needs to be filtered : search},{})

the second document here is the projection parameter > only return required info / fields

To filter the documents in a collection use > db.collectionName.find({name : "harry",imdb:8},{name:true,imdb:true,plot:true,cast:true,_id:false}) > id is default field but can be configured
